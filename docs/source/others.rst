Take many of these skills to other consoles like grandMA, Hog, or MagicQ

In the node editor and 3D view, nearly all OSC syntax is wholly customizable. The only exceptions are the collapsible toolbar buttons on the left and the Patch system. While other consoles have not been tested, there is no known conceptual factor limiting the system to Eos-only. To change the scene-level templates, go to Settings from the Shader Editor and expand the OSC templates tab. There, you will find descriptions and tooltips explaining what to do. 

In the sequencer, there are many features only compatible with Eos. The features that should work with any console are trigger strips (but probably not offset effects) and animation strips.
