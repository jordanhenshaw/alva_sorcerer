Hello there, human!
===================================

**Alva Sorcerer** is a Blender add-on that uses OSC to remote-control universal lighting consoles, but primarily ETC Eos consoles. Sorcerer is intended for anyone with access to a lighting console (or activated lighting console software like ETC Nomad) who likes the lighting console and definitely wants to keep the lighting console, but wishes the console was a little more user-friendly. Especially while trying to focus on art and emotions instead of technical concepts. Alva is useful for cue building and especially useful for timecoding. While it can be used as a busking assistant, Blender and Sorcerer are not Performance-rated, so we recommend only relying on them during design time, not during the final performance with an audience.

Sorcerer is also intended for someone trying to create ALVA technical theatre designs. ALVA stands for Animated Lighting, Video, and Audio. Currently, Sorcerer is capable of animating stage lights and 3D audio objects at the same time. This means you can make a mover track a 3D audio object moving through the house. It also means Sorcerer can connect you to the animation powerhouse that is Blender, allowing you to create extremely sophisticated lighting animations—through existing lighting consoles you already have. Once a design is perfect, it can be saved onto the lighting console as a “qmeo” to be played back almost like a video, without Sorcerer.
