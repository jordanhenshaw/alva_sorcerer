Rotate a gargantuan cube above the stage:
============================================
With Sorcerer, you have access to dynamic spatial selections, or “influencers”.  You can use a cube (or other simple 3D shapes) to make dynamic selections that change over time throughout a sequence. The cube has its own lighting parameters. When the cube passes over lights in 3D view, the lights inherit the cube’s parameters. When the light is no longer within the cube, the light is released back to its background state. 

This allows you to, with enough fixtures, make it look like invisible objects and shapes are moving throughout the theater. You can even use Blender’s physics simulations to make it look like cubes are colliding with each other or bouncing on the ground.

This also provides you an extremely intuitive way to create some simpler effects. If you want it to look like an effect is moving across the stage, you simply animate the effect to move across the stage. No syntax required.
