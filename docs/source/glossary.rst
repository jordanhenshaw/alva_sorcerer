===========
**Qmeo:** It’s basically a video, but each frame is a lighting cue. The Sorcerer orb creates these on the console through OSC by creating a cue for each frame of an animation sequence and then setting up an event list to fire all of them at the right time. The orb then allows the user to set up start cues/macros and end/cue macro when the qmeo is being built from the sequencer. The qmeo builder in the node editor is compatible with many types of lighting consoles while the version inside the sequencer is only compatible with Eos.

**DDC:** Design Drag Coefficient. This is an engineering/physics coefficient used to mathematically quantify exactly how much drag is introduced in the artistic design process by dumb software decisions. A software with very low DDC will not inhibit an artist’s creative impulses. An artist using software with high DDC will not have creative impulses to begin with. Not a single design decision during the Alva Sorcerer project was made without asking the question, “Does this increase DDC or decrease DDC?”

**LPCI:** Lazy Pixel Count Index. This is engineering trigonometry used to mathematically quantify exactly how many pixels in a UI are unused, are doing nothing, and cannot be put to work by the user because they are too lazy. Note: reasonable use of white space does not contribute to LCPI since white space, when used correctly, does serve a valid purpose and does decrease DDC. Not a single design decision during Sorcerer UI development was made without asking the question, “Does this increase LPCI or decrease LPCI?”

**Lighting Choreographer/Lighting Sculptor/Lighting Animator:** These are all terms used to describe simultaneous disciplines within the new theatrical light design field made possible by Blender and Sorcerer. A *lighting choreographer* uses the tools to make lights dance the same way groups of humans dance. With posing, rhythm, cadence, expression, and inertia, often with the aid of flash strips and flash nodes. A *lighting sculptor* is more of a slow-motion painter, working slightly less with time and more with the intricate details of specific cues with the aid of the node editor. The *lighting animator* instead focuses on imbuing specific lighting fixtures with humanlike movement that exudes emotions. They may work extensively with motion capture, the NLA editor, and the graph editor to force the audience to care about the feelings of specific fixtures. To the lighting animator, every lighting fixture can be made an actor with nearly the same emotive responsibilities as the human ones. 

Noticeably absent from this list is the term “lighting pro****mer”. Pro****ming is what *we* do here at Alva Theaters. Leave that to *us*, the software developers. Stage lighting should be thought of as *art*, **NEVER** as "pro****ming".

**“Performance Capture” vs “Mo***n Capture”:** Technically, what Sorcerer does is called “mo***n capture” since it barely captures a single armature, if that. However, the term “performance capture” reflects the broader artistic intent of capturing emotive expression far more accurately, so here it is called performance capture. 

**Motor Node:** A feature not yet introduced to Sorcerer. This node will serve as a sort of oscillator for a node-based effects engine that should be released by EOD.



**EOD:** At Alva Theaters, “EOD” means End of December.

**Alva Theaters defines the following four software reliability ratings to describe its software products.**

**Experimental-rated (E):** “It should work.”

**Design-rated (D):** “We know it works under normal circumstances.”

**Performance-rated:** “If you rely on this software during a live show and it fails you, it’s our fault.”

**Safety-rated (S):** “The software is reliable and safe enough to directly control systems that can physically hurt humans under predictable circumstances that are not otherwise regulated by the government.”

**All publicly available Alva software is Design-rated according to Alva Theaters.**



**Alva Theaters core mission:** "*To build magical machines to make people happy.*"
